# Shibui Source

All source code that is run on Shibui is available here, including all edits (that are publically required to display: ripple base. If we have any private made software we do not guarantee it will be publically available)

You may clone our source to use, however you cannot claim it as your OWN as it isn't even our own: its based off of Ainu's source which is based off of Ripple or other edited source of the likes of Ripple. Not only does it cause issues for us, but for you, Ainu and Ripple if you fail to listen to this: you've been warned!

<a href="https://github.com/osushibui/lets">LETS</a> - Reliable for score submission, replays, direct and other non-realtime feature.

<a href="https://github.com/osushibui/pep.py">pep.py (Bancho)</a> - Handles most other client-side features that LETS doesnt: Blush (the FokaBot equivalent on Shibui), chat, logins etc.

<a href="https://github.com/osushibui/hanayo">Hanayo</a> - Main frontend of the server. This includes and runs all of the website (besides the admin panel) in one instance: hanayo. It contains the GO, HTML and CSS required to run the website.

<a href="https://github.com/osushibui/api">API</a> - Kind of a middleman between everything, grabs stats for profiles, clans etc.

<a href="https://github.com/osushibui/old-frontend">Old Frontend</a> - The old deprecated frontend of Ripple that is not use anywhere anymore. The only reason this is live on all servers (including Ripple and every other server) still uses this code is for the admin panel. Everything besides the Admin Panel is run on Hanayo.

<a href="https://github.com/osushibui/avatars">Avatar Server</a> - is what it says on the tin: it handles avatars.

<a href="https://github.com/osushibui/blush">Blush (Discord Bot)</a> - Real time in-game integration for stats, top plays etc.

If you need any support with our source (PLEASE dont ask for me to setup a server for you, I wont!) then join our Discord (available from our <a href="https://shibui.pw">website</a>) and message James (me) for support. I will help you as much as I can, but please don't be a retard.
